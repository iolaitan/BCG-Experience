EDA – what is the data showing?

1.	The highest number of churn with regards to the sales channel shows that the ‘foods..’ channel customers have churned the highest
2.	The churn rate for the gas and electricity is 9.72%
3.	Churn in the ‘lxidp’ Origin channel is higher than the other origin/offer channels 

Data cleaning and transformation:
- Data types
- Missing values - (Customer Data) - there were a number of columns that had over 75% of thedata missing, with one field 'campaign_disc_element' with 100% missing data (implying an empty column). This discovery in the
exploratory stage allows for appropriate planning on how to deal with missing values.
There were some columns a small percentage of missing values in the columns. For the columns with over 75% of missing data, these records were removed and the other columns with a low % of missing values, the missing values were imputed using the median

From the above output we can see that there are a number of columns that have over 75% of the data missing. We can also see here that the column campaign_disc_ele has 100% of the data missing; this confirms the empty column discovery in the descriptive statistics step.
The above output shows that there is a low % of missing values in the data. In this case, we will replace these missing values with approxomates in the data transformation stage.




Feature Engineering: 
When creating models, a number of new features can be created using characteristics relating to customer engagement, customer demographics, products, pricing as well as customer satisfaction data, if available.

-	How can churn data changed over the years? Has it increased lately or decreased overtime? 
-	Tenure: loyal vs new customers – which customers tend to churn more?




Modelling
The objective of the model is to determine if churn is driven by the customers price sensitivities and that it would be possible to predict customers likely to churn using a binary classification model as a predictive model; where the potential outcome will either be churned (1) or not churned (0).


Questions – how did they determine which is the SME data?
How did they apply the discount?
