Data cleaning and transformation:



Feature Engineering: 
When creating models, a number of new features can be created using characteristics relating to customer engagement, customer demographics, products, pricing as well as customer satisfaction data, if available.

-	How can churn data changed over the years? Has it increased lately or decreased overtime? 
-	Tenure: loyal vs new customers – which customers tend to churn more?




Modelling
The objective of the model is to determine if churn is driven by the customers price sensitivities and that it would be possible to predict customers likely to churn using a binary classification model as a predictive model; where the potential outcome will either be churned (1) or not churned (0).


Questions – how did they determine which is the SME data?
